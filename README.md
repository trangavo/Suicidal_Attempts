## CS112 FINAL PROJECT
This is the final project for CS112 - Information Based Decisions, Fall 2018. Group project with Hanna Getachew.
### Description
The project is a replication of a study on the impact of neighborhood collective efficacy on suicide attempt rate in the US. The dataset consists of observations for 1052 adolescents in 78 different neighborhood in Chicago between 1994 and 1999. The original study concluded that neighborhood collective efficacy did indirectly impact suicide attempt rate through its interaction with family attachment. However, our replication with further analysis proved otherwise.
